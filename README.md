# nrepl
Tools for the not-repl in Erlang

These are a bad idea.  You shouldn't use these.  These are generally how I cope 
with libraries that aren't written with REPL use in mind.  These are jack shims
to get things to compile.  They're probably wrong and they're certainly evil.

Run.  Run now.

`nrepl` is MIT licensed, because viral licenses and newspeak language modification are evil.
Free is ***only*** free when it's free for everyone.

You still shouldn't use it, though.
